Thanks for listening to my talk!

The inspiration for giving it comes from on-going consulting work for a client,
where I've been tasked to build language agnostic simulation testing for
distributed systems.

I've documented the progress, so far, in a series of posts:

1. [Introduction to simulation
   testing](https://stevana.github.io/introduction_to_simulation_testing.html)
2. [Using Maelstrom to test distributed
   systems](https://stevana.github.io/using_maelstrom_to_test_distributed_systems.html)
3. [Sketching how to simulation test distributed
   systems](https://stevan.github.io/sketching_how_to_simulation_test_distributed_systems.html)

Feel free to get in [touch](https://stevana.github.io/about.html) in case you
got any questions, comments or feedback!
