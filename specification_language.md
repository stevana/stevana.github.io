# Specification language

## Motivation

* Joe on languages vs specification languages
  - https://youtu.be/ed7A7r6DBsM?t=632

* API vs protocol
  - Martin Thompson: https://youtu.be/bzDAYlpSbrM?t=837

* Scaffolding
  - testing
  - docs
    + glossary: https://youtu.be/fTtnx1AAJ-c?t=518
  - code generation
  - program inference?

## Joe's Universal Binary Format (UBF)

* https://erlang.org/workshop/2002/Armstrong.pdf

## Cleanroom software engineering

* blackbox vs statebox vs clearbox specification
  - https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_harlan/16/
  - https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_harlan/12/
* trace specifications
* usage model/ operational profile
  - users/actors are part of the specification

## Dave Snowden

* connections are more important than components in complex systems
* "people are objects too"
* break down a concept until there's no disagreement about its meaning

## Some of my own ideas

* Mostly stealing from all above and gluing things together
* Informal escape hatches, but still structured and checked
  - useful for documentation and program inference?

## Contributing

* Thoughts?
